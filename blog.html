      <p><b>In</b> the small town of Layyah in southern Punjab, cricket was usually played as a pastime, on dusty,  cricketing infrastructure. Yet, it was here, amid cement wickets and empty lots, that a young boy’s passion for the game took root, setting him on a path to become one of Pakistan’s most exciting batting prospects. Today, Layyah buzzes with pride as its sons and daughters gather around television screens, watching their own Hasan Nawaz take on the world’s best. “People in Layyah now watch Pakistan matches especially to see him bat,” says Hamza Tariq, a childhood friend who played alongside Hasan at the local Hi-Ways Cricket Club. “There’s a rising craze among youngsters here. Many have taken up hard-ball or tape-ball. They think, if Hasan can reach the top through hard work, why can’t they?” Hasan’s cricketing journey began in the housing colony of Layyah, where he lived with his family. At just 12, he was already facing bowlers much older than him in local tape-ball matches, his fearless approach evident even then. Hasan Nawaz’s story is one of grit, passion and unrelenting hard work. He’s shown us that dreams don’t have boundaries “We used to ride to matches on my Yamaha two-stroke,” recalls Hamza with a chuckle. “Those rides, even the times the bike broke down, are memories we still laugh about. He even mentioned it when he came back from the New Zealand tour.” That tour, in March this year, would mark Hasan’s arrival on the global stage, before the batter would go on to consolidate his place in the Pakistan Twenty20 International side. The lack of proper facilities in Layyah — where the Sports Complex and Degree College grounds were the best available — did little to deter Hasan. <br><b>T</b>ournaments were rare, but his hunger for the game was insatiable. At 14, under the pretext of pursuing studies, he moved to Islamabad to chase his cricketing dreams, supported by his sister who provided him a home in the capital. There, he joined the Lashings Club and later represented the Islamabad Cricket Association at the Under-19 level, laying the foundation for his ascent. In Islamabad, Hasan’s work ethic set him apart. “He didn’t have a dedicated coach or teacher,” says Ahmer Najeeb Satti, an Islamabad-based former club cricketer and analyst who has closely followed Hasan’s journey. “He was a little boy when he came here, but his passion was immense. He’d play two to three matches a day, corporate cricket, practise in the nets. He’s his own coach, a rare talent.” Hasan’s breakthrough came in the 2022 Inter-District Tournament, where he smashed three centuries, catching the eye of selectors. This led to his selection for the Mirpur Royals in the Kashmir Premier League (KPL), where he emerged as the second-highest run-scorer, amassing 241 runs in six innings at an average of over 40 and a strike rate nearing 150. Playing alongside stalwarts such as Shoaib Malik and Imad Wasim, Hasan’s ability to clear the ropes — hitting the second-most sixes in the tournament — announced his arrival as a top-order basher. His performances earned him a contract with Islamabad United for the 2023 Pakistan Super League (PSL) season, but limited opportunities and an injury curtailed his impact. In six PSL matches, he scored 71 runs at a strike rate of 109.2, with a highest score of 41. Unfazed, Hasan returned to club and district cricket, honing his craft. “He went back,. His recent struggles in the recently concluded tri-series have exposed vulnerabilities against disciplined bowling attacks. His high back lift, as Moin noted, remains a challenge on seaming tracks, and consistency at the international level is a hurdle he must overcome. With Pakistan’s selectors keeping a close eye, Hasan’s ability to adapt and address these weaknesses will define his long-term success. What sets Hasan apart is not just his talent but his mindset. “He’s shown us that dreams don’t  struggles reminding us that he is sti continues to chase greatness.

      <p>KARACHI: Business stakeholders have expressed divergent views on the impact of floods on supply chains, with some citing delays in interprovincial cargo movement and crop damage, while others insist supplies of food, fuel and medicines remain normal. The federal government has already imposed a climate change and agriculture emergency after floods in Punjab moved downstream towards Sindh, heightening fears of food inflation. Official estimates put the damage at 4.2 million people affected, 1.58 million animals lost and over 4,400 villages inundated in Punjab, with houses and farmland also destroyed in Gilgit-Baltistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. According to media reports, exceptionally high flood levels have been recorded at Panjnad Headworks on the Chenab River, while medium levels continue at Sindh’s Guddu and Sukkur barrages. Cargo delays hit retail/e-commerce Chain Store Association of Pakistan (CSAP) Chairman Asfandanyar Farukh said cargo movement between Punjab and Sindh has slowed due to floods and damaged infrastructure. Goods now take two to three days longer to reach destinations compared to normal schedules, he added. Cargo delays, crop losses and rising food inflation risks emerge as stakeholders assess floods’ impact E-commerce deliveries, particularly between Karachi and Punjab, are also delayed by two to three days, leading to cancellations by impatient customers, he said. Fertiliser Manufacturers of Pakistan Advisory Council (FMPAC) Executive Director retired Brig Shershah Malik said the floods that struck in late August have badly hit agriculture in Punjab, KP and Sindh. Although fertiliser application for the kharif season was almost complete — with 100pc DAP and 90pc urea already applied — standing crops including rice, sugarcane and vegetables suffered extensive damage. About 1.5m acres of farmland have been affected in Punjab and KP, while data from Sindh is awaited. He warned that farmers’ financial losses and their inability to afford fertiliser could undermine wheat sowing in October, creating a risk for food security during the upcoming rabi season.
